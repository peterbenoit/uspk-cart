# Segment 15: Cart Styling, Mobile Layout, and Persistence

## Purpose

Improve the user experience of the cart by refining the styling, ensuring mobile responsiveness, and persisting cart state across reloads or tab closures.

## Goals

- Enhance visual layout of the cart page for both desktop and mobile
- Add responsive styling for key elements (items, totals, buttons)
- Store cart ID in `localStorage` and ensure it is reused correctly
- Reload cart contents reliably after page reload or tab revisit

## Tasks

- [ ] Apply spacing, borders, typography, and responsive layout to the cart UI
- [ ] Make the cart usable on smaller screens (mobile-friendly)
- [ ] Confirm `cart_id` is saved to and read from `localStorage`
- [ ] Ensure cart is fetched and rehydrated after refresh
- [ ] Provide fallback UI if no `cart_id` is found
- [ ] Ensure user can access /cart from icon in Header

## Notes

- This segment does not modify checkout logic or cart manipulation functions
- Styling should follow the aesthetic defined by the rest of the project (Tailwind)

## Follow-ups

- Segment 16: User login and authentication experience
