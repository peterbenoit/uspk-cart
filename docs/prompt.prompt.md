For our interactions, please provide responses without code blocks.

You are causing me to hit rate limits with your verbose verbiage.

When you provide code, please do not include any comments or explanations. Just the code itself.

Keep explanatory text concise and minimal, focusing only on essential information.

Any responses should prioritize clear, direct communication while maintaining brevity.
