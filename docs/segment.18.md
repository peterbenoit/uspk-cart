# Segment 18: Redirect to BigCommerce Hosted Checkout

## Purpose

Enable users to proceed to a secure checkout flow managed by BigCommerce using their hosted checkout interface.

## Goals

- Retrieve the BigCommerce checkout URL for the current cart.
- Redirect the user to this URL upon clicking “Go to Checkout.”
- Ensure cart integrity before redirection.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `getCheckoutUrl(cartId)` helper that calls the BigCommerce Cart API and retrieves the `checkout_url` field.
- [ ] On the cart page, attach this call to the “Go to Checkout” button.
- [ ] Handle edge cases (e.g., missing cart ID, expired cart).
- [ ] Provide fallback messaging if checkout URL is not available.

## Notes

- BigCommerce handles all checkout logic; this app only initiates redirection.
- Security, taxes, shipping, and payments are handled by BigCommerce.
- Optional: track event before redirection for analytics.

## Follow-ups

- Segment 19: Customer authentication and managing sessions (optional).
- Segment 20+: Order confirmation page or custom order summary display (optional).
